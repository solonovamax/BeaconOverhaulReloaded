# Beacon Overhaul Reloaded

> This is a fork of [Beacon Overhaul](https://github.com/ChloeDawn/BeaconOverhaul) by Chloe

**A mod for Minecraft that improves game mechanics around beacons**

- Night vision, fire resistance, nutrition, long reach, slow falling, and health boost are new effects that can be given by a beacon.
- A points system for beacons, with where more expensive materials grant a more potent effect.
- Higher potency of night vision, allowing the player to see everything with midday lighting (full bright) and no fog effects.
- 2 new effects, Long Reach, which increases interaction reach, and Nutrition, which passively restoring food levels.
- Adds a dropping mechanic to slow falling, allowing sneaking to cause a fall at normal velocity whilst still negating damage.
- Increases step height with jump boost, allowing the player to step up blocks instantaneously when the effect is applied.
    - Note: Auto-jump takes precedence, and will need to be disabled for this to have any effect.
- Beacon beam redirection using amethyst clusters. (Credit to vazkii & Quark contributors)
- Smooths out beacon beam colour changes
- Use tinted glass to make the beacon beam transparent
- More blocks can be used in the beacon base: Copper & Amethyst
- New & Improved beacon UI
- Extremely configurable
